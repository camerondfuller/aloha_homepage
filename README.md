Experience from the project:
This project furthered my understanding of HTML and CSS specificity. It also introduced Flexbox, a new-ish concept for working in html. Instead of using floats to manipulate divs on the page, Flexbox allows devs to position divs and children divs with ease. While on the first version of this project, I had to copy a hack to center the text in the banner image, Flexbox allowed me to put center align it on both the x and y axis easily.
This project also introduced the jQuery library and how to include scripts and plugins.
